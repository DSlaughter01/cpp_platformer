Things are getting a bit confusing re. how to know which file is being rendered? Right now it is dependent on me knowing how I coded it, which is probably not good design

Task 1: Create a more efficient way of passing the entities to the systems - i.e. vectors which store rendering info etc.
Task 2: Untangle rendering of entities
Task 3: Create more components
Task 4: Collision system
