TODO NEXT
Optimise quadtree update
Change vertical and horizontal collision detection to only act on collidingPairs

Resolve collision bug when the player collides simultaneously horizontally and vertically
Implement a more efficient way of doing collision detection
Add coins and maybe a solid aspect (to collision component?)
Scoring system 
Enemies
Asset handler

General Comments:
1\ File EntityManager.cpp function GetComponent. It would be good to be able to add multiple components at the same time

2\ File Game.cpp function GameLoop. Combine LoadPlayer and LoadTilemap and maybe some other info into a LoadGame or LoadLevel function

3\ The flipping of sprites assumes that they are all facing the same way. May need to set a starting direction and then see whether m_dir is different in order to flip or not

4\ Collision detection:
Assuming for the moment that fixed objects do not have a velocity component, but will come back to that later because it is not robust
