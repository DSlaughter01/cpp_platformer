Things are getting a bit confusing re. how to know which file is being rendered? Right now it is dependent on me knowing how I coded it, which is probably not good design

Task 1: Collision system
Task 2: Don't allow continuous jumps

- Check whether the entities are colliding, and if so, what to do with them
- If not, it should not, but this should still be returned because the 
- Should the function return pairs of objects that are colliding?
- Then the returned object should be passed to 2 functions - one horizontal and one vertical
- If the entity has a velocity component, its behaviour should be updated 
- The outcome of the 2 hor/vel functions should determine how the movement is updated


Checking collision:
Presumably need some notion of left and right rectangles, or maybe top and bottom depending on the context
These could be returned in the collision function
The objects are passed to the movement system, and the movement system changes the velocity 

In which possible scenarios would velocity need to be updated? 
Can I just have one function which updates velocities in all different scenarios?
    Left key is pressed
    Right key is pressed
    Spacebar is pressed
    Player collides with an object (different responses for horizontal and vertical) 
    Later on, two enemies collide
    If damage is given out
    If a bullet is fired and then
        - hits someone
        - dies
